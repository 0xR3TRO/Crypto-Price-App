## System Architecture

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data on cryptocurrency prices, user preferences, and transaction history, including:

- **Cryptocurrency Prices:** Current and historical prices across various exchanges.
- **Favorite Assets:** User-defined list of preferred cryptocurrencies.
- **Alert Settings:** User preferences for price alert notifications.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on microservices where:

- **Backend:** Handles business logic and database interactions.
- **Frontend:** Presents the user interface and manages user interactions.
- **Database:** Stores data on prices, user preferences, and transaction history.

## Implementation

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), MongoDB (database for prices and user preferences).
- **APIs Used:** Cryptocurrency exchange APIs for fetching real-time price data.
- **Security Measures:** HTTPS protocol and data encryption for user security.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for frontend components, backend services, and data management.
- _Coding Style:_ Modular and commented code for improved readability.

## Testing

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Testing:** Verify correctness of data fetching and price analysis functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure proper interaction between frontend and backend components.
- **UI Testing:** Evaluate usability and responsiveness on different devices.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess application speed and responsiveness under varying user loads.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop test scenarios for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified issues.

## Deployment and Maintenance

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixing, publication on user-accessible platforms.
- **Timelines:** Set dates for planned stages and application updates.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for user issue reporting and support.
- **Updates:** Plan regular application updates based on market needs and user feedback.

## Schedule

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide tasks into specific phases (e.g., interface implementation, API integration, testing).
- **Timelines:** Estimate time required for each stage and adjust schedule based on project progress.

## Cost Estimate

### Estimated Costs:

- **Development:** Costs based on team hours and UI/UX design efforts.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Server fees, external service charges, and user support expenses.
